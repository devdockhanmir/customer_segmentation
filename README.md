# Customer Segmentation on Mall Customers

This project focuses on customer segmentation using **unsupervised learning** techniques such as **K-Means Clustering** and **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)**. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographic data.

## Overview

Customer segmentation allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and boost sales. In this project, we apply **unsupervised learning algorithms** to cluster customers of a shopping mall into distinct groups based on their characteristics.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about mall customers, including:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (in $)
- Spending Score (1–100)

**Source**: [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, MiniSom (for SOM implementation)

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Data**: Checked for null values and addressed them if necessary.
- **Encoding**: Converted categorical data (Gender) into numerical format.
- **Normalization**: Scaled the data for better clustering results.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed the distribution of features (e.g., age, income, spending score).
- Identified patterns and correlations using visualizations like histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps.

### 3. K-Means Clustering
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Analysis** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualized clusters in 2D and 3D spaces for better interpretability.

### 4. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)
- Implemented SOMs using the MiniSom library.
- Visualized clusters on a SOM grid, providing an alternative perspective on customer segmentation.

## Results

### Key Insights:
- Segmentation identified clusters such as **low spenders**, **high spenders**, and **average spenders**.
- Gender, income, and spending score were significant factors in customer grouping.

### Visualizations:
- Cluster distribution plots.
- SOM activation maps.
